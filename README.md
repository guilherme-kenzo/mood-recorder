# Mood Recorder

A Rest API to keep track of my mood during the day. A very simple project intented to be used by a single user in a local network scenario. It was created to be used alongside [homeassistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and a 3d-printed streamdeck-like device. All together, they make up a mood recorder/visualizer â€” and for kicks, you can automate things based on your mood!
